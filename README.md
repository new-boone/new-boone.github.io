Boone's Dark Theme (Updated, 2020)
==================================

Custom theme designed for Utopia (http://utopia-game.com).

- Modern design. 
- Clean and minimalistic look.
- Dark palette that's easy on the eyes.
- Sticky navigation sidebar.
- Easier to read integrated uMunk intel.


How To Use
==========

1. Click on your account name on the top right of the screen, then click on 'Account Settings'.
2. Under custom theme, enter 'http://boone-theme.github.io/' exactly.
3. Click 'Apply', then go through the lobby or relog (instead of hitting backspace).


Notes
=====

- If you don't see any changes, clear your browser cache (hit CTRL + F5 or manually clear it in browser settings).
- No detailed changes to monarch, steward or paid pages as I did not have access to them.


PHP Error/uMunk Stops Working
=============================

Although this does not seem to occur on mobile browsers, occasionally, you may get a php error on your Throne page and uMunk stops working. I suspect this is the result of using any custom theme. To fix this:

1. Click on your account name on the top right of the screen, then click on 'Account Settings'.
2. Check 'Remove Custom Theme' checkbox and click 'Apply'.
3. Go to the Throne page and let uMunk update it.
4. Click on your account name on the top right of the screen, then click on 'Account Settings'.
5. Under custom theme, enter 'http://boone-theme.github.io/' exactly.
6. Click 'Apply', then go through the lobby or relog (instead of hitting backspace).
